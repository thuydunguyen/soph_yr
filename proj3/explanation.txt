Proj 3 late submission explanation:

The shortestPath method of Router class was not working properly and needed debugging. It was going along the wrong paths. The reason for
that was because everytime I added a node into the PQ, I was replacing any old nodes rather than creating a whole new node entry.
Also trying to fix for style points and hopefully time tests.

On another note, I didn't start the project until Tuesday, so that probably factored into the late submission.
