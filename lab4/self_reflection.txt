All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I would have used pointers and if I had used pointers, I would have used two separate methods (like in the staff solution) to increment/decrement rather than have them in one method.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Was pretty clean for my standards.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Made copies of the original array multiple times in the class.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: THe autograder tested for performance speed.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would have used pointers to make my code run constant time and not use array.copy for my addFirst/removeFirst methods.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: My code passed all the autograder tests.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: A lot of lines and repeated "if statements". Tried to incorporate circular lists, but not sure if it actually worked.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: N/A

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Added comments to make keeping track of my methods easier in case I needed to debug. Take some time to clean upmy code.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Liked the idea, but these questions are a little hard to discuss about with a partner.
